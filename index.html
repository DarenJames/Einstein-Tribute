            <li><span class="blue-text">1913</span> Works on his new theory of gravity.</li>
            <li><span class="blue-text">1914</span> Becomes director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin and professor of theoretical physics at the University of Berlin. Maric and the children move there in April, but they return to Zurich after three months. Divorce proceedings begin. In August, World War I begins.</li>
            <li><span class="blue-text">1915</span> Completes the general theory of relativity.</li>
            <li><span class="blue-text">1917</span> Collapses from exhaustion and falls seriously ill. Nursed back to health by his cousin Elsa Löwenthal. Publishes his first paper on cosmology.</li>
            <li><span class="blue-text">1919</span> Marries Löwenthal. On May 29, a solar eclipse provides proof of the general theory of relativity.</li>
            <li><span class="blue-text">1922</span> Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1921.</li>
            <li><span class="blue-text">1927</span> Attends fifth Solvay Conference and begins developing the foundation of quantum mechanics with Niels Bohr.</li>
            <li><span class="blue-text">1928</span> Begins pursuing his idea of a unified field theory.</li>
            <li><span class="blue-text">1932</span> As a Jew, begins to feel the heat of Nazi Germany. Now, at 53, at the height of his fame.</li>
            <li><span class="blue-text">1933</span> Sets sail with Löwenthal for the United States. Settles with her in Princeton, New Jersey, where he assumes a post at the Institute for Advanced Study.</li>

            <h3>Einstein's Theory of General Relativity</h3>
            <p>The general theory of relativity, is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and is the current description of gravitation in modern physics. It provides a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time or four-dimensional spacetime. Some predictions of general relativity differ significantly from those of classical physics, especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light.</p>
            <p>Examples of such differences include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, the gravitational time delay and singularities/black holes. The predictions of general relativity in relation to classical physics have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date.</p>

            <h3>Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity</h3>
            <p>Special Relativity is a scientific theory regarding the relationship between space and time. It was proposed by Albert Einstein in a paper published on 26 September 1905 titled “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies”. Today, special relativity is proven to be the most accurate model of motion at any speed when gravitational and quantum effects are negligible.</p>
            <p>Special relativity has a wide range of consequences that have been experimentally verified. They include the relativity of simultaneity, length contraction, time dilation, the relativistic velocity addition formula, the relativistic Doppler effect, relativistic mass, a universal speed limit, mass–energy equivalence, the speed of causality and the Thomas precession.</p>
